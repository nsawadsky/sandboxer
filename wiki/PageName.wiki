This page contains required action-items: decisions and implementation tasks

= Decisions =

 # Decide how the application under test (AUT) is run:
   * Either using SandboxLoader which is a separate Java application _or_
   * As a normal application with a command line argument of using the agent which in turns triggers sandboxing
 # Define heap usage of package, so that we can enforce user-defined limit in a reasonably intuitive way.
   * Consider case where package holds reference to large object passed by client.
   * Candidate definition: All memory reachable from:
      * Static references within classes defined by the package.
      * Stack-local variable references belonging to threads that are created by the package.
