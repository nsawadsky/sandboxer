# Details #

[Memory leaks](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__all__&product=Log4j&content=leak)

[Deadlocks](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__all__&product=Log4j&content=deadlock)

[Infinite loops](http://www.google.ca/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&=&q=log4j+infinite+loop&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=).  These are from Google, as not so many show up in Log4j issue tracker.  Perhaps these occur more often due to misuse of Log4j, rather than bugs?
